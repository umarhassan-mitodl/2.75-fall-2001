Prerequisite
------------

2.72 or machine elements experience

Lectures and Recitations
------------------------

Lectures: Twice a week for 1.5 hours each.

Recitations: There is no formal class recitation, instead, each team will be scheduled to meet once a week with the instructor for detailed design discussions on their projects.

Projects
--------

There are six week long projects and 12 week long projects. Students must complete 12 weeks of projects. The projects can be viewed on the course web site. Students MUST self organize and determine which projects they will do.

Textbook
--------

Slocum, A. H. _Precision Machine Design_. Dearborn: Society of Manufacturing Engineers, 1995.

Incredibly useful handbooks every practicing design engineer should own:

*   _Machinery's Handbook_. NY: Industrial Press.
*   Roark, R. J., and W. C. Young. _Formulas for Stress and Strain_. McGraw-Hill Book Company.

Grading
-------

This is very much an interactive course, and you have a very low chance of passing the course if you do not attend lectures and participate in the design process with all the teams. The final grade is given based on the first and only problem set (10%), everybody grading everybody else's projects (80%); AND your demonstration of mastery of the material in the textbook as your project progresses (10%). There are no quizzes and no final.
